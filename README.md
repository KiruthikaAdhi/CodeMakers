# Safe Route Finder
We are team Code Makers from Anna University. This is our repository for the codefundo++ hackathon.

The idea we propose for the hackathon is **"Automatic detection of damaged roads after a disaster and suggest an alternative safe route for 
the users"**. The users can be civilians, emergency responders or aid workers.

1. We will be building an deep learning solution which compares the pre and post disaster satellite images to detect the damaged roads.
2. We will use this detected data and use Google Maps or OpenStreetMap API to suggest an alternative safe route which does not include the detected damaged road.
